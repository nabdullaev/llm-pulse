### LLM Pulse: Real-Time Tracking and Sentiment Analysis of LLM Trends on Twitter.

The goal of LLM Pulse is to provide an interactive dashboard that captures, analyzes, and visualizes both real-time and historical Twitter data focused on discussions around large language models such as GPT‑4, Gemini, and Claude. Through a combination of sentiment analysis, trend tracking, and keyword extraction, the application tells the story of how public discourse about these models evolves over time. Users—ranging from researchers and developers to entrepreneurs and investors—will gain key insights into the popularity, sentiment, and emerging topics associated with each LLM. The visualization aims to answer questions like: Which LLM is currently trending? How is public sentiment changing? What are the key keywords driving these discussions? The tool empowers users to make informed decisions by providing dynamic, interactive visual representations of complex social media trends.
